# 3. Flow Control Reflection

# I spent 1 hours on this challenge.

Learning flow control was pretty straightforward. The only change was looking up methods and syntax specific to ruby. If the ruby docs didn't explain a method well, I was able to find a better explanation through googling. I feel my digging through the ruby documentation is getting better/quicker. I feel confident with flow/conditions. I enjoyed pairing up with Paul in this exercise. We hammered through it quickly!
