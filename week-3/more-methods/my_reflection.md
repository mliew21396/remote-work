# 5. More Methods Reflection

# I spent 2 hours on this challenge.

Using the readings as the source, we realized this wasn't sufficient. During the Paired session, we ended up looking at the ruby docs a bunch to find methods that were even better than we thought of the top of our heads. Finishing these exercises, we bothe realized how important looking at the ruby documentations was. We feel better at reading documentation. I enjoyed doing the exercises and actually thinking abstractly to solve the problems at hand. This was fun.
