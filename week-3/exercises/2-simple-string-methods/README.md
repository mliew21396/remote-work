# U1.W3: Simple String Methods

## Learning Competencies
- Create local variables
- Apply basic Ruby methods to variables

## Summary
Create a `String` variable called `old_string` and assign it the value `"Ruby is cool"`.

Use `String` methods to modify the `old_string` variable so that it is now `"LOOC SI YBUR"` and assign this to another variable called `new_string`. Keep the `old_string` assigned to `"Ruby is cool"`

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

For the first few of exercises only, type `rspec my_solution.rb` to run the tests. (Make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
