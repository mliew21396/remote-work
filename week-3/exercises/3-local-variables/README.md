# U1.W3: Local variables and basic arithmetical operations

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables and methods
- Apply basic Ruby methods to variables

## Summary
Create two integer variables called `num1` and `num2` and assign them your favorite numbers.

Next, compute the sum, difference, quotient, product, and modulus of these two numbers and assign these values to variables called `sum`, `difference`, `quotient`, `product`, and `modulus`, respectively. Read Pine's chapter 6.4 for help with `modulus`.

For the quotient, be sure to convert the variables to `Floats` before dividing.

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

For the first few of exercises only, type `rspec my_solution.rb` to run the tests. (Make sure you are in the proper directory).

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
