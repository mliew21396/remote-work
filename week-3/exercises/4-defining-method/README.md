# U1.W3: Defining an empty method

## Learning Competencies
- Define a method that accepts arguments

## Summary
Define a method called `do_something` that accepts three parameters.

You do not need to write any code in the body of the method.

## Releases

## Release 0: Pseudocode
Consider what you need to do to solve the challenge. You can write it down if it will help you, or you can move on to the next release.

## Release 1: Initial Solution
Code your solution in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 2: Test
Now that you are writing methods the spec files can be put in a separate file, so you will need to run the specs differently. Follow these instructions for all remaining challenges.

Type `rspec` followed by the **spec file name** (and make sure you are in the proper directory). For example:

`rspec defining_variable_spec.rb`

If you are getting "0 tests and 0 failures", you probably ran the solution file, be sure to run the spec file!

Run the tests to make sure your code passes!

## Release 3: Refactor
Make any necessary changes based on the tests. Then run the tests again.

Make sure all the tests pass before moving on.

## Release 4: Publish
When your solution is passing all of the tests, commit and push your changes!
