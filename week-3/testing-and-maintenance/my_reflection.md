## 9. Testing and Maintenance Reflection

#### I spent 0.5 hours on this challenge.

Include images of your maintenance schedule (inline, using markdown) below:

Schedule: My maintenance schedule would have me check the site for an hour each sunday, preferably in the morning. The first 30 minutes will be brainstorming ideas to add that I've learned the work to add to my TO DO list. The last 30 minutes will be to add modifications to my site.

- While testing, did you find any errors in your code? How did you handle them?
- Did you receive any particularly helpful feedback? Why was it helpful?
- How do you plan to incorporate the feedback you received?

I found some links that went to the wrong page - I fixed these. I haven't received any feedback from the feedbackinator but I have heard some from my partners while working with them. It was helpful. I'll continue to try and ask more questions and jump in when an idea comes up more often. In terms of tasks for this week, I'm working on adding more images to make it prettier.
