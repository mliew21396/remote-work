# 2. Methods Reflection

Reading the material was very insightful. I learned little details that I didn't realize before. I enjoyed the exercises because they engrained the material through repetition. Variables and methods make sense overall. The readings covered some non-local variables so I'm curious how they are used in a bigger project. I feel pretty confident with variables and methods and am ready for more advanced material. Being able to use rspec was very helpful because I've dabbled with selenium before.
