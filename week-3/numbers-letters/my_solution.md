# U1.W3: Methods: Notes for Numbers and Letters

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

#### I spent 0.5 hours on this challenge.


### Summary
- What does `puts` do?
It writes on the screen what comes after it.
- What is the difference between float and integer division?
Float divison will include decimals, while integer division will only use whole numbers, always rounding down.

### Try it!

My solution for:

1.  Hours in a year

```ruby
puts 24*365
8760
```

2. Minutes in a decade

```ruby
puts 60*24*365*10
5256000
```

## Reflection

Reading Learn to Program's first 4 chapters was informative. I learned syntax since I have some experience with JS and PHP. For syntax questions outside the scope of reading, I googled. I learned about the cool to_f method which forces a number to a float. I feel pretty strong with this material.
