#U1.W3: GPS 1.2: Git Cheat Sheet

**DO NOT LOOK AT THIS CHALLENGE UNTIL YOUR GUIDED PAIRING SESSION!!**

## Learning Competencies
- Wireframe a website based on requirements
- Link to the CSS stylesheet from the Unit 1 Repository
- Evaluate existing HTML tags such as `<DOCTYPE>`,`<title>`, `<charset>` and the version of HTML
- Compare different HTML elements to one another
- Apply CSS to position and manipulate elements on an HTML page
- Explain the difference between margin, padding, and border
- Dress up the page by incorporating fonts, colors, images, and general design using CSS

## Summary
In this GPS you'll be reviewing git, HTML, and CSS all in one! Your goal is to make a simple webpage using a two-column layout. You'll also want a header and footer. The code was adapted from GitHub's [Git Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

**Don't forget to check in!**

## Release 0: Wireframe the site
First, you'll want to create a wireframe. In this wireframe, you will want to draw space for:
- a Header
- 2 Columns for content
- a Footer

The goal of this challenge is to create an simple cheat sheet, **not** a replica of GitHub's PDF. Simply position the content using the wireframe requirements above.

If you want to use a collaborative drawing site, you can use [Precursor](https://prcrsr.com/) or [flockdraw](http://flockdraw.com) (It's like a collaborative version of MSPaint). You don't need an account, and you can invite people by sharing the URL. You can also use any other wireframing tool and share your screen. (Or use a pen and paper and share).

## Release 1: HTML
Before you get started, take a brief look at the HTML and evaluate the following:

- What is the DOCTYPE specifying?
- What is the point of a charset?
- What version of HTML is this? Do you think it's easier, more difficult, or the same in terms of readability as other versions?
- What does `<title>` do?

Each of you should include a link to the phase-0-unit-1/week-3/9-gps1-2/gps1-2.css stylesheet in your html and show each other. Explain how to link a stylesheet.

Go to [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), this is a tool to collaborate on coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Press the "Collaboration" button and share the link provided to start the session. This website provides a way to code together and render the HTML and CSS.

Navigate to the gps1-2.html file and copy everything **between the `<body>` tags** and paste it to the HTML window. Click run (or ctrl + enter) to render the HTML.


## Release 2: Position the Elements
Now's the time to position all of the HTML elements based on the wireframe you created. Use CSS as much as possible. It's considered bad practice to incorporate styling into HTML tags. Use CSS only to create the two columns. You will not need to add anything to the HTML to do this.

HINT: Add `background-color` to each element to see where each element is to help you position them.

Be sure to compare margin, border, and padding with your pair.

## Release 3: Dress it up!
Once you've got the elements where you want them, you can decide to dress it up. Change the colors, fonts, add pictures of an octocat, etc. Have fun with it.

## Release 4: Reflect

Reflect on your learning. Did you feel more confident with CSS positioning? How did you do with the learning competencies in general? Add your reflection as a comment in your gps1-2.html file.

## Release 5: Copy, commit, and push
When you are finished, copy your code into the [gps1-2.css](gps1-2.css) and [gps1-2.html](gps1-2.html) files. Make sure your css from the `<style>` section is in the CSS file and remove it from the HTML section. Update the html file. Then, test that everything is still  working by saving them and running them together from your computer.

Commit and push your changes onto the phase-0-unit-1 repository.

If you want to use this cheatsheet later, or add to it, you may want to add it to your github.io site.

## Release 6: Give Feedback
Don't forget to give [feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) to your pair!
