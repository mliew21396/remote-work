# 4. Arrays (and Hashes) Reflection

# I spent 2 hours on this challenge.

I enjoyed learning some data structures with arrays and hashes. I picked up the concepts easily though the syntax was frustrating at times. I had to keep referencing the sources to double check. Hashes are very interesting and I want to learn the more advanced ways to use it such as with a hash with many values. I enjoyed the exercises generally, but was frustrated with the explanations sometimes.
