# 1: Command Line Reflection

Write your reflection on a document or by hand on the following questions. Keep track of your answers because you'll be asked to add them to this document in challenge [6: Tracking Changes](../tracking-changes).

1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"

The shell is a program that takes commands and gives them to the OS to perform. Bash is a type of shell program.
2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The most challenging part was the shear amount of commands to remember. I had to keep looking up the commands and syntax I wanted to use.
3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

I was able to use most but I still don't really understand the Pipes and Redirection section. I need to do more research/examples on this.
4. In your opinion, what are the most important arguments to know?

To me, the most important arguments to know are cd, pwd, ls, and less. I can see find and grep being useful but I need more real life scenarios.
