## Tracking Changes Reflection

- How does tracking and adding changes make developer's lives easier?
Tracking and adding changes make save points so if the developer makes a mistake later on, he can revert his changes to before the mistake. It's also nice to see the progression of the project through tracking.
- What is a commit?
- What does the HEAD^ argument mean?
- What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one to the other?
- Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?
- What is a pull request? Why do you think they are preferred when working with teams?
