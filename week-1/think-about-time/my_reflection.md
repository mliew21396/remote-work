# U1.W1: Thinking About Time Reflection

* How do you manage your time currently?
* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
* What techniques did you look into during this challenge that interested you?
* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I currently break my time into a few hour segments. I jump in and take 1-5 minute break every hour just to stretch and compose myself. Sometime an hour can last forever so I’ll try the Pomodoro technique and see how that works. A technique that caught my eye was meditation. My dad has been trying to convince me to meditate for the past few years and I think this can be the time to actually do it. What resonated with me the most from the meditation article was to start with little steps: just meditate a few minutes a day to get in the habit. I’ll try and implement meditating either in the morning or evening as well as between work segments. Overall, I’ll tackle the courses in chunks for little successes. These chunks will be broken into 30 minute segments(Pomodoro style) and will have meditation sessions at least once a day to clarify my focus.
