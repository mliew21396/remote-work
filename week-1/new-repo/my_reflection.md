## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a new repository, navigate to github.com/new and add a repository name. You can specify this repository to be public or private as well as whether you want a to initialize a README file with the repository. Click the Create repository button to create a new repository. To clone the repository to your local computer, navigate on the terminal to the folder that will host the git files. Next type "git clone [url]" and you should get a 100% done message in the terminal.

Open source means a software that can be shared, allowing others to customize the programas as they see fit. I like open source because it allows as many people to contribute as they want. I believe people are inherently good and as a community will help push progress harder. Licenses in general are good because they upfront let people know how you can use other's code.

The Git/Github add,commit, and push concepts were reinforced. It felt good to create a site and all the Git processes with it smoothly.
