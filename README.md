# Unit 1: Introduction

Welcome to Phase 0! Below you will find links to the curriculum for each week. Technically each Phase 0 week begins on Monday and will be released each Monday. The week's work is due the following Monday at 10:00am PST.

### [Week 1: Git, GitHub, and the Command Line](week-1/README.md)
### [Week 2: HTML and CSS](week-2/README.md)
<!-- ### [Week 3: Introduction to Ruby](week-3/README.md) -->

## Important Tip
Phase 0 is a remote program, which means there will be a lot of reading required. Be sure to read the README files thoroughly. That's why they are called "README" files (this is an industry standard).

Whenever you encounter a typo or confusing instruction, please make a note of it or direct our attention to it. The curriculum is always being improved; it's not a static or perfect project. We want your help to make it better.

## Required Books
You will need to get four books for Phase 0 (and Dev Bootcamp). There are two others that may be useful to you. Some are available for free online, and others will need to be purchased. Please make it a priority to get these books early.

- *[Learn to Program, 2nd edition](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)* by Chris Pine. This is used in Week 3. The first edition is available for free. We designed the curriculum around the second edition. You can purchase the 2nd edition directly from the publisher, or on Amazon. You can probably get by with the first edition, but there will be chapter and some content discrepancies.
- *[The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.manning.com/black3/)* by David A. Black. This book will need to be purchased. The second edition recently came out, and we've negotiated a discount code for the 2nd edition only that will give you 45% off the list price if you buy it from the publisher.* The code is: **rubycl14**. We have negotiated this code especially for Dev Bootcamp students, so please keep it to yourself. Amazon also offers both versions at competitive prices and may be cheaper and faster if you have Prime. You'll need this by Week 3. The second edition will be useful for longer, but the first edition is also acceptable.
- *[Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR)](http://www.poodr.com/)* by Sandi Metz. This book needs to be purchased and will be used in Week 6.
- *[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)* by Marijn Haverbeke. This is available for free online and will be used in Week 7.

#### Optional
We've gotten great feedback from students about these books. Amazon sells these together in a package at a discount if you want to get both.

- *[HTML and CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/)* by John Duckett. This would be useful for Week 2.
- *[JavaScript and JQuery](http://javascriptbook.com/)* by John Duckett - Useful in Week 7 and 8.
