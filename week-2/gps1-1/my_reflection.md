## 11. GPS 1.1 Reflection

#### I spent [1.5] hours on this challenge.

- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was unsure on how merges worked exactly with teammates, specifically how it appears on their screen when we are both contributors.
- What was clarified during the GPS?
I now have a better understanding on merges between two contributors.
- What (if anything) was made more confusing?
Everything made more sense.
- How was your first experience of pairing in a guided pairing session?
The experience went great! By us both working on the syntax together, it was further engrained in us.
- Was having a guide there intimidating? helpful? reassuring?
Peter was super helpful when we had any hiccups.
- What were your 'aha' moments?
My Aha moment was seeing merging in action =)
