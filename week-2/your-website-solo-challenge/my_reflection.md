# 8. Creating your website Reflection

My Wireframe URL:

My Website url: http://mliew21396.github.io/

#### I spent 6 hours on this challenge.

Discuss the following:
- What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
- What would you like to add or change about the site next?
- Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
- Create a TODO list of features you want to add in the future.
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I was glad I had a wireframe to work off of. It kept my ideas collected and organized. Working on each section individually with a plan kept everything relatively smooth... I still had problems arise that took so long to figure out.. Next I would like to still improve the design and projects section. Something is still funky with the layout that I haven't figured out yet. Throughout building the site, I gained a much better understanding of the display and float properties.
TODO list:
1) Improve design of site - still primative
2) Flush out Project section more
3) Expand about section on home page so it's more informative
4) I used a variety of resources, but the key takeaway is that having to keep looking up syntax enforced my knowledge
