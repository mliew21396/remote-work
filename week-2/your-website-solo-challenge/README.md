# U1.W2: Your Website (Solo Challenge)

**THIS IS YOUR SOLO CHALLENGE FOR WEEK 2.** Please reference the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/) for more details as to what this entails.

## Learning Competencies
- Use wireframes to construct a website
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Format HTML elements using the CSS padding, borders, and margin properties
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.

## Summary

In this mega challenge, you will make your [USERNAME].github.io site using the principles of design, site map, wireframe, and HTML and CSS you've learned this far. You may not use Bootstrap or any other design framework for your site.

Get creative. Have fun, but be conscious of time. This site will be a work in progress, so you should timebox each release. You will be making improvements each week as an assignment. This version is your MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

Pomodoro is a common and effective timeboxing and productivity technique that we can use in this exercise. Basically you do 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break. You can use your own timer or this web application [moosti](http://www.moosti.com). Take a second and estimate how many units you want to work on each section, and see where you are by the end. Then you can decide if you want to continue adding more time. You will be improving your website as you go through the program. Don't burn out now!

## Releases

## Release 0: Review your Wireframes

Knowing what you know about HTML and CSS, review your the wireframes you created for your index.html, blog/index.html, and blog-template pages in the [wireframing](../wireframing) challenge. Do you need to make any changes based on what you've learned so far? If so, make the changes and upload your new wireframes to this directory.

You don't want to get horribly stuck on making this complicated, so if you have a pretty complicated wireframe, you may want to make it a little simpler.

## Release 1: Design
Now is the time to consider the colors, fonts, icons/logos, images and overall look and feel of your site. You may want to use some of the following resources:

- [Adobe Color CC](https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to create a color theme for your site
- [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) to consider fonts

You also may want to complete the bonus challenge, [Make a Mood Board](../BONUS-challenges/mood-board), to help you solidify your design.

Again, don't get bogged down in your research trying to make your site perfect. You aren't a paid designer or front-end developer, so it is unreasonable to expect to make a site that is as beautiful as many of the sites out there. Yours will probably look like it was made in the early 2000s (unless you have previous design experience), so make it acceptable and be kind to yourself and where you are in your learning. You should make it a goal to revisit your site each week to add to it.

## Release 2: Development - index.html page

Using the wireframe you created and design ideas as references, add the HTML and content your index.html page in your [USERNAME].github.io site using HTML. You may want to focus on using HTML5 semantic elements instead of `<div>`s. Try to use the HTML5 semantic elements. They are far more readable, and HTML5 has a ton of built in awesomeness that you can start exploring. This is the new standard -- so it's good to get practice with it.

Once you have all of the content on your index, make sure your HTML passes validation by running it in through a [validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).

You may want to refer to these resources for HTML5 help:

- [HTML5 Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp)

## Release 3: Development - Create the blog/index.html

Now it's time to build your blog/index.html file. This is where people will go to view the list of your blog posts (not the blog posts themselves). Be sure to add links to your week 1 blog posts! Check your code through an HTML validator to make sure it passes validation before moving on.

Remember, your website is a work in progress. Do not deviate from your wireframes until you've built your MVP (unless your wireframes are too complicated, then it's fine to simplify them). As we often say at DBC, "Done is better than perfect."

## Release 4: Development - Create your blog template
You can either build your blog template HTML page from scratch, or use/modify the template provided in this folder. Remember to use your blog-template wireframe as a reference when building this page.

If you are using the template we provided, you may not want to have unnecessary text you'll have to delete each time, so delete the temporary Web 2.0 ipsum text. If you want to add comments like ```<!-- insert title here -->``` to make it clear what information goes where, that might be useful.

## Release 5: Apply CSS
Now you can truly begin to appreciate CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Each page can have a similar look.

In the main directory for your [USERNAME].github.io site, create a "stylesheets" directory. Add a `default.css` sheet. Using [this document](http://www.basictips.com/using-multiple-external-style-sheets.shtml) as a reference, add the default.css stylesheet to each html page you've created.

In your `default.css` stylesheet:
- Position the elements to match your wireframes
- Add styling to your header and footer
- Add and integrate the colors you want into your site
- Incorporate the fonts you want on your site
- Format any images you've added

Don't forget about Chrome Devtools for testing out your style changes and figuring out if you are selecting elements properly.

REMINDER: Are you being true to your MVP or are you working on new features? Don't deviate from your original wireframes until AFTER you've built your MVP.

## Release 6: Blog Template CSS (Optional)

If you want a separate `blog-stylesheet.css` file to customize your blog template, you can create the file in the stylesheets folder and link to it from the `blog-template.html` file (under the `default.css` file. Then you can add any CSS to personalize your blog posts, and it should still keep the styling from your `default.css` stylesheet unless you override it in this new stylesheet.

## Release 7: Publish
When you feel ready to publish your new site, add your files to the stage, commit your changes, and create/merge your pull request. Post your site on Twitter using **#DBCmysite** to ask for feedback from your peers.

## Release 8: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

## Release 9: Review (optional)
Check out your peer's websites and leave comments as issues. Search for them using the **#DBCmysite** hashtag!
