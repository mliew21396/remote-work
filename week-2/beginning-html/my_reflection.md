## 4. Beginning HTML Reflection

#### I spent 0.75 hours on this challenge.

- What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't?
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- Did you have any "aha" moments where any concepts solidified? What were they?
- Did you have any previous experience with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list them.

What makes sense is the structuring of HTML. I need to still work on when to divide the HTML template into the correct groupings. HTML seems easy to use and quick to display a website's skeleton. HTML can quickly get repetitive because if you are creating really long lists. My partner Bill helped me understand grouping can be more indepth. I have practiced HTML for the past year on and off. I used a variety of online sources that I can't remember off the top of my head. They were probably TeamTreehouse.com
