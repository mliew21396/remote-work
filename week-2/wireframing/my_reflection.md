## 3. Wireframing Reflection

#### I spent 1 hour on this challenge.

*Remember, reflections should only take about 10-15 minutes.*

Include images of your wireframe (inline, using markdown) below:

Wireframing was fun. I enjoyed adjusting the webpage visually. I kept revising my wireframe after I saw my inital layout. I wondered how other people used wireframe so I googled sample wireframes. I'm still not sure which is the best wireframe tool, but I'll have to try out more. Each wireframe tool is definitely it's own getting used to. I feel strong about basic wireframing from this lesson. I used Mockingbird, but specifically not being able to copy and paste between the pages was annoying.
