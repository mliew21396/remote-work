## 5. Beginning CSS Reflection

#### I spent 2 hours on this challenge.

- What makes sense to you about CSS? What doesn't?
- What seems good and bad about CSS?
- Did you have any "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
- Did you have any experience before with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?
- When you looked at Berkshire Hathaway's source code, what were your first impressions of their code?
- Which site followed best practices based on what you know about best practices?

The straightforward assigning of the values to the property makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the organization. CSS seems like it can snowball out of control if you don't properly order your CSS. Working in a pair, we understood some syntax better together. I have about a years experience with CSS on and off. Looking at the Berkshire source code, I can't really tell if what they did was better but different. Eg they used a table HTML while we used CSS off an unordered list. I feel both mine and the actual site followed best practices but I need more experience with HTML/CSS.
